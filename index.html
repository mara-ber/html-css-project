            "Flowers for Algernon"
         </h2>
        <summary>Flowers for Algernon is a character study of one man,
             Charlie Gordon. Charlie is a 32-year-old developmentally
             disabled man who has the opportunity to undergo a surgical 
             procedure that will dramatically increase his mental capabilities.
              This procedure had already been performed on a laboratory mouse, 
              Algernon, with remarkable results. Charlie will be the first human
               subject. In a series of progress reports, Charlie documents 
               everything that happens to him. As Charlie's intelligence 
               increases to a genius level, the reader not only reads about 
               the changes from Charlie's viewpoint, but also sees the change 
               evidenced in Charlie's writing ability. This jump in 
               intelligence is not necessarily a good thing, however. 
               Charlie is now able to recall past events that shaped his 
               life and analyze past friendships for what they were, or weren't. 
               He also has difficulty making new friendships and establishing 
               new relationships due to a lack of social intelligence that the 
               surgery could neither correct nor anticipate. And, finally, 
               because of his increased intelligence, Charlie is able to discover 
               the experiment's "fatal flaw" and is reduced to watching the end 
               for both Algernon and himself, hoping to salvage something for 
               the future from his brief bout with genius.</summary>
