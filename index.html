         <h2>"Flowers for Algernon"</h2>
        <summary> A science fiction short story and a novel by American writer 
            Daniel Keyes</summary>
            <p>Flowers for Algernon is a character study of one man,
             Charlie Gordon. Charlie is a 32-year-old developmentally
             disabled man who has the opportunity to undergo a surgical 
             procedure that will dramatically increase his mental capabilities.
              This procedure had already been performed on a laboratory mouse, 
              Algernon, with remarkable results. Charlie will be the first human
               subject. In a series of progress reports, Charlie documents 
               everything that happens to him. As Charlie's intelligence 
               increases to a genius level, the reader not only reads about 
               the changes from Charlie's viewpoint, but also sees the change 
               evidenced in Charlie's writing ability. This jump in 
               intelligence is not necessarily a good thing, however. 
               Charlie is now able to recall past events that shaped his 
               life and analyze past friendships for what they were, or weren't. 
               He also has difficulty making new friendships and establishing 
               new relationships due to a lack of social intelligence that the 
               surgery could neither correct nor anticipate. And, finally, 
               because of his increased intelligence, Charlie is able to discover 
               the experiment's "fatal flaw" and is reduced to watching the end 
               for both Algernon and himself, hoping to salvage something for 
               the future from his brief bout with genius.</p>

        <h2>"Confessions of a sociopath"</h2>
        <summary>A book written by a female law professor under the pen name 
            of M.E. Thomas, describing her up-and-down life as a self-diagnosed 
            sociopath</summary>
            <p> first memoir of its kind, Confessions of a Sociopath is 
             an engrossing, highly captivating narrative of the author's life as 
             a diagnosed sociopath.

            She is a charismatic charmer, an ambitious self-promoter, and a cunning 
            and calculating liar. She can induce you to invest in her financial 
            schemes, vote for her causes, and even join her in bed. Like a 
            real-life Lisbeth Salander, she has her own system of ethics, and 
            like Dexter, she thrives on bending and occasionally breaking the 
            rules. She is a diagnosed, high-functioning, noncriminal sociopath, 
            and this is her world from her point of view.
            
            Drawn from the author's own experiences; her popular blog, 
            Sociopathworld.com; and scientific literature, Confessions of a 
            Sociopath is part confessional memoir, part primer for the curious. 
            Written from the point of view of a diagnosed sociopath, it unveils 
            for the very first time these people who are hiding in plain sight. 
            The book confirms suspicions and debunks myths about sociopathy, 
            providing a road map for dealing with the sociopath in your life.</p>

        <h2>"Educated"</h2>
        <summary>A 2018 memoir by American author Tara Westover</summary>
            <p>“Educated” by Tara Westover is a memoir that describes the 
            struggle of a young girl who escapes from violence and an emotional 
            prison. It is a conflicting story of fierce family loyalty as well 
            as that of the intense sorrow that arises from the division of one’s 
            closest ties. The author created a universal story that gets to the 
            heart of what education is and its benefits. “Educated” is also a 
            fearless account of love and brutality, an account of biological 
            relationship and power of imagination, and lastly, an account of a 
            young lady whose courage, knowledge, and intellect lights up every 
            page of the story. Westover’s “Educated” portrays the unstoppable 
            efforts of a young lady who is determined to change herself. The memoir 
            is a perfect example of things humans can achieve if they set their 
            minds to it.</p>
